It is a time of tremendous opportunity and promises when adolescents begin to explore their growing individuality and independence and begin to think critically about themselves and the world around them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"display: flex;gap: 6px;align-items: center;\"><img height=\"26px\" src=\"//cdn.testbook.com/resources/lms_creative_elements/key-point-image.png\" width=\"26px\" /><strong><span style=\"vertical-align: middle;font-size: 21px;\"><u>Key Points</u></span></strong></span>&nbsp;In the <strong>social sphere</strong>, adolescents undergo a <strong>lot of changes</strong> in their <strong>interpersonal relationships and they also begin to understand society and its diverse influences</strong>. The dependence on parents noted during childhood gets <strong>transformed into dependence on friends and peers</strong>. And adolescent starts to develop an attraction towards members of the opposite sex. Adolescents also begin to acquire beliefs, opinions, attitudes, and stereotypes about a society based upon their own understanding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Characteristics of Adolescents&rsquo; Social Development</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Increased peer group influence</strong>:\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Adolescents spend most of their time outside the home and with members of the peer group, so peers have a greater influence on the attitudes, speeches, interests, appearance, and behaviour of adolescents.</li>\n\t\t<li>Being recognized as a popular member of a peer group is an important adolescent need.</li>\n\t\t<li>Adolescents often get into arguments with their parents and elders since they want to break away from their control.</li>\n\t\t<li>As adolescence progress, peer group influences begin to wane.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Changes in social behaviour </strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Attraction towards members of the opposite sex is another prominent characteristic of the adolescent.</li>\n\t\t<li>This is natural and occurs mainly because of the sexual maturity taking place among adolescents.</li>\n\t\t<li>Social activities whether with the same sex or with the opposite reach its peak in the high school years.</li>\n\t\t<li>As a result of broader opportunities for social participation social insight improves among older adolescents.</li>\n\t\t<li>The greater the social participation of adolescents, the greater their social competency, as their social skills and abilities develop.&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>New social groupings</strong>: The gangs of childhood gradually break and the interest in the organized groups controlled by the adults also wanes. They like to be a part of the group control of the group controlled by them.</li>\n\t<li><strong>New values in the selection of friends</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Adolescents no longer select their friends on the basis of ready availability at school or in the neighbourhood, as they did during childhood.</li>\n\t\t<li>Adolescents want as friends those whose interests and values are similar to theirs, who understand them and make them feel secure, and in whom they can confide problems and discuss matters they feel they cannot share with parents or teachers.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>New values in social acceptance:&nbsp;</strong>The values of the adolescents largely depend on the value system of their peer&nbsp;group which is used to judge others. And they often feel that the value that they hold are in conflict with their parents or society at large.</li>\n\t<li><strong>New values in the selection of leaders:&nbsp;</strong>Adolescents want their leader with some superior abilities and skills because he/ she is representing their group in the eyes of society. Adolescent expects their leaders with certain qualities, like attractive, intelligent, energetic, eager to do things, etc.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Influence of media:&nbsp;</strong>Media becomes a very powerful source of influence in this stage, especially music and television. These provide adolescents with role models like film heroes, great athletes, etc., whom they try to emulate. Such models help adolescents realize their fantasies and dreams.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Body-conscious:&nbsp;</strong>Body image becomes a very important concern for adolescents. Having an appropriate figure, in fact, is almost a teenage obsession.</li>\n\t<li>In addition, fashion and glamour reflected in the style of dressing, sporting, make-up, having the right hairstyle, etc. become very important in their lives. These are associated with the social roles that adolescents want to develop and to experiment with.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>From the above,&nbsp; we can conclude that a high decrease in friendly

Socialization is culturally specific: people in different cultures are socialized differently, hold different beliefs and values, and behave in different ways.&nbsp;The goals of socialization are to teach us to control biological impulses as children, to develop a conscience that fits with the norms of society, to teach and develop meaning in social life (what is important and valued), and to prepare us for various social roles and how we will perform them. So, from this, we conclude that socialization helps to shape the personality of the individual also. Hence, <strong>option (2) is correct.</strong></p>\n<br><br><p><strong>\u0938\u092e\u093e\u091c\u0940\u0915\u0930\u0923</strong>&nbsp;\u0915\u094b \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f

            "solution": "<p>Piaget and Vygotsky proposed theory regarding the role of language for development and the relationship between language and thought.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>According to Piaget,</strong> thought comes before language, which is only one of its forms of expression. The formation of thought basically depends on the coordination of sensory-motor schemes and not of language. This can occur only after the child has reached a certain level of mental abilities, subordinating herself, to the thought processes. The language allows the child to evoke an object or event absent at the communication of concepts.</li>\n\t<li>Piaget insists that the language and thought of the child are aspects of cognitive processes. The intellectual development of the child can be understood through his/her language and thought processes.</li>\n\t<li>Piaget primarily concentrated on the cognitive aspect, another dimension was added by Vygotsky</li>\n\t<li><strong>According to Vygotsky</strong>, thought and language is <strong>interdependent </strong>processes, from the beginning of life. The acquisition of language by the child modifies its higher mental functions: it gives a definite shape to thought, enables the emergence of imagination, memory usage, and action planning.</li>\n\t<li>All fundamental cognitive activities including language take place in a matrix of <strong>social history</strong>. He believed that cognitive skills and patterns of thinking are not determined by innate factors but are the product of the<strong> interaction between the individual and the socio-cultural institution where the individual grows up.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/tb-img/production/19/10/F1_A.B_Madhu_18.10.19_D1.png\" style=\"width: 340px; height:

Creating and maintaining stimulating learning environments can be achieved through&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">effective classroom organisation, interactive and whole school displays and a climate of innovation</span>.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Learning and maturation:</span>&nbsp;Maturation is related to the process of growth. It describes changes that are relatively independent of the environmental influence and are assumed to be closely related to the influence of heredity. Learning on the other hand is shaped primarily by an individual&rsquo;s interaction with the immediate environment. For example, beginning to walk depends on the maturation of certain muscle groups and on increasing control over their movements (maturational developments).</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Readiness to learn:&nbsp;</span>Mental readiness of the pupil is essential for learning. For example, in the case of language learning, it is not expected from a child to learn difficult words and sentences at an early stage of learning. Similarly for physical activities like typewriting, dancing etc. requires physical readiness of the pupil. Effective learning takes place when the pupil is ready to learn.&nbsp;Hence, to determine readiness, you need to have some knowledge of children&rsquo;s emotional and intellectual development.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Learning and Motivation:</span>&nbsp;Motivation refers to the force originated or generated in the individual which sustains, directs and controls the activities of the pupil till the goal is achieved. There are two types of motivation- intrinsic motivation (motivation from inside) and extrinsic motivation (motivation from external rewards).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

Children with this disorder <strong>cannot recognize subtle differences between sounds in words</strong>, even when the sounds are loud and clear enough to be heard. Children suffering from this disorder are <strong>unable to block out background noise</strong> or to tell where the sound is coming from.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n\t<li>A student with APD may also have <strong>Language Processing Disorder (LPD),</strong> which is a specific type of APD in which students find it<strong>&nbsp;difficult to attach meaning to sound groups that form words, sentences and stories.</strong> These disorders can, in turn, affect expressive (what someone says) and receptive (understanding what was said) language&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><strong>Dyslexia:</strong> It is a <strong>specific language-based learning disability that affects reading</strong> and related language-based processing skills. The severity of it can differ in each individual and can affect reading comprehension, decoding, fluency, word order, etc. It is sometimes referred to as a Language-based Learning Disability.</li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><strong>Nonverbal Learning disability (NVLD)</strong>: A disorder characterized by a significant discrepancy between higher verbal skills and weaker motor, visual-spatial and social skills. Children having this disorder may <strong>struggle with interpreting non-verbal cues such as facial expressions or body language</strong> and may also have poor coordination.</li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><strong>Visual Motor/Visual Perceptual Deficit:&nbsp; </strong>A disorder that affects the <strong>ability to perceive visually processed knowledge.</strong> It affects the understanding of information that a child sees. Such as the ability to draw or copy. It&nbsp;refers to a reduced ability to make sense of information taken in through the eyes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><br />\nHence, as can be seen from the given points<strong>, Language Processing Disorder
