The perception of a trade-off between the two goals rests on the view often held — wrongly — that environmental protection, not environmental degradation, is the obstacle to rapid growth. The reality, however, is that it will not be possible to sustain high growth in the coming years without environmental care.<br>The reason is that we are facing a twin crisis — economic and environmental — and the two are highly interlinked. The spike in food prices, the second in three years, signals in good measure, pressures on production that are exacerbated by the deleterious effects of environmental devastation and climate change. While some may set aside the global risks of climate change as being distant, recent extreme weather events point to changes that may already be upon us.<br>To be clear, sustained growth has been the most powerful means to reduce poverty, especially in China, India and elsewhere in Asia. China's growth averaged 10 per cent yearly for the past 25 years, lifting some 400 million people out of poverty. Developing countries need to grow a great deal: their average incomes are one-sixth that of rich nations.<br>That said, climate change presents the greatest threat to sustaining high growth. In the past 100 years, the world economy expanded sevenfold, the global population increased from 1.6 billion to 6.5 billion and the world lost half of its tropical forests. Consequently, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are now 385 parts per million (ppm) and rising fast. This is close to the 450 ppm threshold beyond which it may be impossible to achieve the Cancun-agreed goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2° Celsius.<br>National economies are already seeing the effects of climate on local agriculture. Natural disasters are on the rise: remarkably it is the hydro-meteorological events, not the geological ones that have shot up, suggesting the ominous link to global warming. The proximate reason for the doubling of wheat prices over the past year is the collapse of production in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere linked to unprecedented heat waves and floods.<br>The economic costs, including the losses caused by air pollution, water contamination and solid wastes as well as deforestation are estimated to amount to some three per cent of GNP in China as well as India, Argentina, Turkey and elsewhere. Strikingly, prevention is often far cheaper than cure — whether it's curbing industrial pollution, arresting deforestation or reinforcing structures in disaster-prone areas. Why then don't governments and businesses universally favour environmental safeguards?<br>One reason is that when it comes to the global aspects, no country, rich or poor, has the economic motivation or the political will to confront them alone. That's because only a part of the benefits accrue to those taking action, while others can grab a free ride. And even when the gains are local, they may only appear after politicians leave office.<br>Second, the split between what's good for society and what drives private interest is perpetuated as many policy and business leaders still do not view the environment as integral to the growth agenda. Mainstream economics has not been helpful in this regard. Most economic projections still assume that high growth can proceed independently of environmental action.<br>Third, policy often worsens the situation by encouraging the waste of natural resources. Growth models are silent on subsidies purportedly used to speed growth — farm subsidies of some $150 billion a year and subsidies to fossil fuels of $650 billion a year worldwide — that encourage energy intensity, emissions and waste. Cutting these subsidies would increase economic efficiency and improve the prospects for growth.<br>If high growth is to continue — be it in Brazil, China, India, or elsewhere — we need to fundamentally correct the calculus that environmental protection hampers economic growth. Economics can be highly influential in this respect. But mainstream economics must reverse its past advice and indicate that the drive for higher incomes can succeed only by including — not excluding — environmental care in growth policies.",

The disparity in per capita rural and urban income has remained persistently high, with an average urban worker earning over eight times an average agricultural worker, according to NITI Aayog. The widening urban-rural divide is also evident in the inequalities in consumption, quality of life, and availability of physical and social infrastructure. To ensure inclusive economic growth, the government needs to urgently focus on transforming the agrarian economy to pull the maximum number of people out of subsistence farming and give them a much more remunerative role.<br>With two-thirds of India’s billion-plus people living in villages, jump-starting the economic engine of rural India will have a multiplier effect on investment, consumption, government expenditure and exports. The potential of rural India can be gauged by the fact that agricultural startups have raised nearly $130 million in about 70 deals in the past five years to 2018, according to a news report. <br>Although agriculture contributes to about 17% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP), its significance to the people of India cannot be overemphasized. In addition to feeding the country, agriculture has nearly half of our 1.3 billion-plus population depending on it for their livelihood. The bad news is agricultural growth is slowing. Between fiscal 2014 and 2019, agri-GDP grew at 2.9% per year compared with a 3.7% per annum growth between fiscal 2005 and 2014.<br>The Narendra Modi-led government has its task cut out. It will need to focus on agri-technologies that can boost agricultural productivity, create value-added farm products and tap “farm-to-fork opportunities\" to ensure better realization for farmers. It will also need to create millions of micro-entrepreneurs and thousands of economic clusters in rural India, besides investing in rural roads, rural electricity, irrigation networks and national cold chain grids.<br>To re-energise the rural economy, the Modi government has been trying to bring in some policy reforms like e-markets, farmer producer organizations (FPOs) and the Model Contract Farming Act, 2018. As Indian farmers have the smallest landholding on the planet, they lack individual bargaining capacity in the open market for their small produce. In such a scenario, the creation of FPOs can give them a competitive edge because they can pool in their produce, invest in cold storage facilities and better negotiate with large buyers. In fact, these FPOs can tie up with business schools to build the knowhow for developing a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem that leads to the creation of a vibrant rural economy. If we can create villages that can directly sell produce to global markets then we will see the ripple effects of a micro-entrepreneurial economy flowing through rural India.<br>While smart government policies, financial inclusion initiatives and investments in infrastructure can help, greater use of technology can fire the entrepreneurial spirit and spur innovation in rural India. Technology can also help farmers’ access to high-quality inputs, crop health and yield data and crucial weather related information. Adoption of advanced agriculture technology through machines and equipment that use data analytics, Internet of Things and robotics can help optimize inputs and enhance yields. Moreover, using technology and data science can help build more efficient supply chains that connect retail grocery stores with food processors and FPOs.<br>Even as we move on the policy front, we must also bridge the huge knowledge gap in Indian agriculture between farmers on one side and crop scientists on the other. Farmers should be trained on micro-irrigation, micro propagation, latest farming technology, smart use of fertilisers, better understanding of crop rotation etc.<br>To conclude, to kick-start the rural economy, we must formulate policies that focus on helping people emerge from an existence of perpetual disadvantage through incentives not hand-outs. A bridging of the urban-rural divide is imperative for long-term sustainable growth of the economy.<br>1) Briefly discuss the menace of Urban-Rural divide in India in context of the passage.<br>2) Discuss the growth of Agri-economy and its potential in India.<br>3) Discuss the measures taken by the government to revive the rural economy.<br>4) According to the passage, discuss the role Technology can play in rural economy of India.<br>5) Briefly describe the Author’s purpose to write this article?",
