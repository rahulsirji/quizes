As the stereotype goes, successful men used to marry their secretaries; now people choose spouses with similar levels of education and earnings. The phenomenon is called ‘assortative mating’. But smart, successful women still have to navigate enormous landmines in their romantic relationships with men.<br>Of course, not all women want to be in relationships or get married. According to a 2020 Pew survey, just 38% of single American women are looking for dates or a relationship. But if women are seeking romantic relationships and they are uber-successful, they often have to choose between career success and romantic success. To change this ugly part of our culture, we need to radically rethink our conceptions of masculinity.<br>Part of the problem is that many men do not want to be in relationships with women who they perceive as smarter than they are. A 2006 speed-dating experiment involving heterosexual Columbia University graduate students found that when a man thinks a woman is smarter than he is, he becomes less interested in dating her.<br>And women who are hugely successful in their careers have said they think it hurts their romantic prospects. As Maureen Dowd wrote in her book Are Men Necessary? When Sexes Collide, the day one of her friends won the Pulitzer, the woman called her “in tears\" saying that as a result, she’d “never get a date.\" Federal judge Frederic Block wrote in his book that Sonia Sotomayor considered turning down her nomination to the Supreme Court because she knew it would hurt her dating life. To state the obvious, successful men don’t tend to have this problem.<br>A woman is also less likely to marry a man if she makes more money than he does. But despite (or perhaps because of?) all this, if a woman is the breadwinner of the household, she and her husband are likelier to be unhappy, experience relationship strife or get divorced, according to census data analysis.<br>When women experience other kinds of career success, it can also jeopardize their relationships. One study found that women who won Academy Awards for best actress remained in their relationships for 67% less time afterwards than men who won best actor awards. Even research out of supposedly egalitarian Sweden found that winning government office doubled a woman’s chance of divorce.<br>The intersection of women’s success and expectations of masculinity could well be one reason there aren’t more women in top leadership positions. Women who go out into the world and do great things should make their families proud. When women earn outsize salaries, their families— including the men—benefit from those resources.<br>But the list of such men in the public eye is not very long. Where are the Hollywood romcoms about men who romantically pursue women CEOs? Their absence is a problem, because men privately say they feel pressured to live up to our society’s conceptions of masculinity, even when they don’t like or agree with them.<br>A solution would start with recognizing the problem. Once we appreciate what successful women are up against, we can look to men to treat them differently—and change the prevalent cultural tropes about masculinity and strength. Then more men might have a change of heart about relationships with successful women, and making them work.",

            "text": "Q. 3 Read the given Passage and answer the Question given below based on the Passage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(40 Marks)<br>The government’s budget announcement that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will soon issue India’s own digital rupee was presumably a reference to the pilot programme for a digital rupee that RBI governor Shaktikanta Das announced late last year, considering that a full-scale rollout would be nearly impossible to pull off in just one year.<br>That being said, there are three critical questions that must first be addressed. One, what problems is a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in India trying to address? Second, what will its design look like? And third, what safeguards do we have in place to ensure the security of this currency and citizens’ privacy?<br>Globally, interest among central banks worldwide to experiment with or fully launch digitized currencies, has grown significantly. In developed countries, governments and central banks are concerned that big tech companies such as Meta (parent of Facebook), could issue their own digital currencies to the users of their vast networks, enabling them to accrue excessive market power. They are also concerned about the decline in the use of physical cash, which anchors public confidence in the monetary system. A central bank issued digital currency, they believe– although by no means unanimously—will not only address these concerns but will also bring in efficiencies in payment management.<br>The need assessment and motivations in India are different. For instance, while other countries, even developed economies, might see CBDCs as a means of promoting digital payments, that is not particularly relevant when we have an efficient, inclusive consumer payment system in the unified payments interface (UPI).<br>India’s UPI landscape has grown tremendously in the last half-decade from just 21 banks with a transaction value of ₹3.8 million in July 2016 to nearly 300 banks with a transaction value of ₹8.3 trillion as of January 2022, data from National Payments Corp. of India shows. Innovations like e-Rupi, a cashless and contactless prepaid voucher-based payment instrument built on the UPI platform, also extend benefits to ‘non-banked’ beneficiaries. Even if CBDCs could increase inclusiveness a bit more, it would be on the margins and would need to be carefully weighed against the potential benefits.<br>RBI must set out the most significant long-term problem to which it believes a CBDC may be the answer. Its assessment should compare CBDC against the alternative means to achieve some of these objectives. This will have implications for design choices as well.<br>The proposed technology to develop this, as per the finance minister’s budget speech, is blockchain, a digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger that exists across a network. But scalability remains a crucial challenge in the use of blockchain. Public blockchains demand a huge amount of computational power, a high bandwidth internet connection, and massive storage space.<br>For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum are able to process 7 to 20 transactions-per-second (TPS), but they also face processing time. Given the size of the population in India, the technology must be suitable to sustain a massive number of daily transactions. The design must also ensure easy accessibility to people with poor digital literacy.<br>The third question is that of privacy and security. A direct model of CBDC, where customer accounts (or wallets) are all handled by the central bank, will not only give the government access to people’s personal spends but create a single point of attack which will make the system more vulnerable to cyber security attack. Protocols and safeguards regarding which organizations will be able to access sensitive CBDC payments data, and for what purpose will that data be used, must be in place before India goes ahead with its digital currency plans.<br>We need a robust data protection regime in place. Our legislation is still in draft stage and will take years to operationalize. It also allows sweeping exceptions for government purposes. Recently, former RBI governor D. Subbarao, said the lack of such frameworks could make the introduction of CBDC not just a technological challenge but also a “tricky political issue\".<br>Answering these questions will not only provide a clear guideway for the launch of a digital rupee but will also ensure that the move truly benefits the Indian citizens and economy.<br>Q. 1 According to the passage, what are the obstacles to launch India’s own digital currency?<br>Q. 2 According to the passage, discuss the benefits of our own indigenous currency.<br>Q.3 According to the passage, what could be the concerns with respect to privacy and security?<br>Q. 4 According to the passage, discuss the way forward in launching India’s digital currency.",
