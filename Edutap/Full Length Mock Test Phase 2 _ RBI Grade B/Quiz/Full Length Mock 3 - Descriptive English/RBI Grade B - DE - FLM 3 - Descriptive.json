With all the efforts put in by the industry in driving digital payments deeper and wider across the country over the past year, India has emerged as one of the fastest adopters of digital forms of payment ever. And still, India continues to retain its tag as the world’s largest cash displacement market in absolute terms. <br>The government’s focus on driving digital payment penetration has certainly been a catalyst over the past year. There has been an evident escalation of digital commerce over these past months, in turn reaping benefits for consumers, businesses and the economy in general. Digitization of payments forms the building block towards creation of a formal and transparent economy, helping us in the fight against corruption, terror financing and unaccounted wealth. In the longer run, moving towards a less-cash economy will boost the country’s GDP and will bring about a deep structural shift in the economy. As we have witnessed over the recent past, it also offers the perfect platform for digital entrepreneurs to innovate and develop products and solutions that could truly change the way the world transact. In particular, open-loop solutions with the potential to reach out to mass markets and help spread the digital footprint far and wide. <br>With over 800 million debit cards and over 30 million credit cards in the market, almost every household in India now has access to a digital form of payment. Even more heartening is the emergence of the humble debit card as a preferred form of payment over the past year. At 3X growth in payment volumes and over 3.5X growth in transactions, consumers are beginning to enjoy the benefits of the debit card beyond its use as an ATM cash withdrawal instrument. Non-discretionary spending categories such as fuel and groceries have emerged among the largest spending categories, indicating digital adoption across the mass market. The single largest reason for this surge could be attributed to the rapid expansion of the acceptance infrastructure in India. <br>Since the start of the year, the industry has added over 1 million new acceptance points, increasing the number to 2.8 million across the country. The trend continues across e-commerce platforms too, with more consumers preferring to transact using digital forms of payments. Notwithstanding the significant progress we have made over the past year alone, there is a lot more work to be done. At a modest 11%, the country’s electronic Personal Consumption Expenditure (ePCE) rate is a far cry from some leading economies around the world with ePCE rates upwards of 60%. By expanding the acceptance infrastructure, energising innovative methods of payments, and bolstering financial participation through stronger, open collaboration, we can continue to move up this value chain in the future. <br>Digital commerce is well and truly on its way to changing the way Indians pay and get paid in the future. The opportunity to leverage digital commerce beckons consumers, businesses and government’s alike. How we seize this opportunity would eventually determine our ability to play a lead role in the transformation towards a digital world.",

            "text": "Q. 3 Read the given Passage and answer the Question given below based on the Passage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(40 Marks)<br>Rupee has been continuously depreciating for the last few weeks and has touched an all-time low of 56 to dollar. Even though the price of crude oil has not increased in the international market, the cost for the oil marketing companies (OMC) like Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat petroleum (BPCL) has been increasing on the account of increased value of dollar. The oil marketing companies have lost around Rs 4300 crores for selling petrol below the cost in the last six months. Since 2010, the petrol has been deregulated and OMCs can increase the price of petrol if there is large variation in their costs. <br>The main reason behind increase in the petrol prices is the rise of dollar against rupee. We need to understand why rupee is depreciating against dollar like a free fall. One of the many reasons cited for the depreciation is the ongoing euro crisis. Many institutional investors have moved out their investments in euro to dollar as dollar is considered to be safe haven. In order to be safe, some investment has also moved out of India. But the euro crisis only cannot justify the free fall of rupee. If we see the other currencies like Pound, Yen, Brazilian Real, there has been no significant depreciation, in fact yen has gained against dollar considering one year time frame.<br>So what are the other significant reasons for depreciating rupee? One of prime reasons is our burgeoning fiscal deficit (difference between revenue and expenditure). The fiscal deficit for the year 2011-2012 stood at Rs. 521,980 and it is targeted at Rs. 513,590 crores for the 2012-2013. This huge deficit is primarily because of subsidy offered on food, fertilizer and petroleum. The oil subsidy for the year 2012-2013 is estimated to be Rs 43,580 crores. But we project the losses suffered by OMCs for the current year, this subsidy will come out to be Rs. 114,000 crores. According to twin deficit hypothesis, there is strong linkage between fiscal deficit and trade deficit (imports – exports). The government’s fiscal deficit is increasing i.e. government is spending more than it is what it is earning. This is because increased expenditure is not matched by the increased tax rates. <br>Hence, people are left with more money, out which some of the money is diverted towards the imports which results in more imports than exports leading to trade deficit. The major portion of our imports is oil. Since oil imports have to be paid in dollars, the importers need to buy dollars and sell rupee leading more demand of dollar and excess of rupee in the market. Considering the demand supply, rupee is continuously losing value; the OMCs have to shell out more rupees for same amount of oil imports.<br>Now if the prices of oil products are not increased, the deficit will keep on increasing further impacting our economy. An increase in price will result into fall in demand which means that fewer dollars will have to be paid for the oil imports, leading to lower trade deficit which will in turn lead to release of pressure on rupee-dollar rate. Another effect of not increasing the prices oil products is that, government will need to compensate the OMCs for the subsidy offered. Government will finance this deficit by borrowing from the market leading crowding out of the private investment which will slow down our economic growth. <br>It may lead to higher interest rates which will increase the common man’s EMIs. The prices of petrol have been increased. This will have some effect on trade deficit and rupee-dollar value but in order to have more pronounced effect, the government needs to increase the price of diesel, LPG and kerosene. An increase in prices of these will help government reduce its fiscal deficit, meaning less borrowing from the market leading to more funds available for the private investment. Hence better economic growth. In the age of coalition politics, these are harsh decisions which the government may not be willing to take. But these decisions will have to be taken, to prevent our economy from stagnation.<br>Q. 1 According to the passage, why petrol price is rising in India?<br>Q. 2 Discuss the twin deficit hypothesis.<br>Q.3 What could be the impacts of the inflation?<br>Q. 4 Discuss how to decrease the fiscal deficit.",
