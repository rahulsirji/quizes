There are a number of such reports coming from all over Ukraine, but President Volodymyr Zelensky knows that wars cannot be won by just emotion. That is why he appealed to the superpowers to intervene immediately. He said what is needed is immediate strategic help and nothing else. This helplessness of Zelensky is enough to show the destruction caused by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Almost a week has passed, but the global fraternity could not do anything as expected. Ukraine is the latest example of this bitter reality of how superpowers use small countries to fulfil their sinister ambitions.<br>Ever since he took office, Putin has been eyeing the ‘old glory’ of his country. He snatched Crimea from Ukraine, eight years ago. In 2008, he attacked Georgia. Even then, the US and the rhetorical did nothing. Once the great empress of Russia, Tsar Catherine, said we needed a window to the world. By ‘window’ she meant the port. She tore Poland to pieces for this. Is Putin pursuing a similar agenda? It would be naive to expect Russia to back down easily.<br>Putin has his own arguments to justify the war. By the time the Cold War ended in 1991, there were 16 countries in NATO. The number has now grown to 30. Russia considers this a violation of mutual consent. The Kremlin feels that its country is under siege. Would this issue be resolved by a war? I am not sure, since even after the biggest warfare, one has to finally sit at the negotiating table. Taking these historical lessons into account, why not begin a proper discussion right away? But how can this be accomplished? We live in a deluded world that is being run by dwarf politicians. They may be patriotic, but the world view and insight needed to run the world are not present with any politician in the present era. We already felt this during the deadly pandemic.<br>More than 20,000 Indians are currently stranded in Ukraine. The government is trying to bring them back at its own expense.<br>One more thing. Putin has knowingly or unknowingly strengthened China. Due to economic sanctions imposed on his country, much of that business will now take its route through China. Not only this, the attention of the world is also shifting from China to Russia. Of course, New Delhi will be keeping a close watch on the situation. It’s time to be careful.",

Now, researchers are monitoring animals both to try to identify any new pandemic-causing viruses, and to try to identify the next COVID-19 variant. <br>“There are hundreds, thousands of coronavirus in many animal species,\" said Dr. Jeff Taubenberger, deputy chief of the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), as quoted by ABC news. <br>“We don’t really know where they all are, we don’t know the full extent of the reservoir. We don’t know what the risks are.\"<br>Studies have suggested that coronavirus has infected minks, hamsters. In North America, it has infected wild white tail deer. And as it infects more species, it continues to evolve constantly. Now researchers are wondering whether it might infiltrate even more species than it is known to and then move back to humans again, potentially bringing new and dangerous COVID variants.<br>“If the virus is able to infect other species, it will evolve differently,\" said Taubenberger. “It could give us a variant that is very different from what we’ve been exposed to.<br>With COVID infecting more species and evolving to be fitter than before, experts are now focusing on developing a universal COVID vaccine that can protect against more variants. <br>Scientists at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research have been working on developing such a universal vaccine, which is currently undergoing the first phase of human trials. This universal vaccine would include multiple coronavirus fragments that could trigger immune responses to different strains of COVID-19, with the hopes of boosting immunity against more variants, the ABC news report said. <br>The next Covid-19 variant will definitely be more contagious than omicron, but the real question is whether or not it will be more deadly World Health Organization pointed out.<br>Previously, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead, said, the next variant of concern will be more fit, i.e. it will be more transmissible because it will have to overtake what is currently circulating. However, “The big question is whether or not future variants will be more or less severe.\"<br>“There is no guarantee of that. We hope that that is the case, but there is no guarantee of that and we can’t bank on it.\"<br>The next iteration of Covid may also evade vaccine protections even more, making the existing vaccines even less effective, she pointed out.<br>Q. 1 According to the passage, what can be said about the next variant of Covid virus?<br>Q. 2 According to the passage, what can be done to prevent such infections?<br>Q.3 According to the passage, what is the view of WHO on next variant?<br>Q. 4 According to the passage, what can be inferred about the new variants of Covid virus?",
