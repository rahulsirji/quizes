On the first day of the COP, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed to include “loss and damage” — compensating countries for climate-induced damages — in the summit’s main agenda. A day later, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres unveiled details of a plan to ensure that “everyone on the planet” is warned of hazardous weather in the next five years. <br>Both decisions were long overdue and their absence from the agenda of the past COPs reflects poorly on the UNFCCC’s commitment to climate equity. Studies and reports — including those by the IPCC — have long warned about the climate vulnerability of nations with a minuscule GHG footprint. Inclement weather events in different parts of the world in the past 10 years have confirmed their worst fears.<br>The idea of “loss and damage” compensations is nearly as old as global climate change negotiations. However, even as sea levels kept rising and countries were ravaged by droughts and floods, climate delegates failed to summon the resolve to develop funding mechanisms to reduce the suffering of communities which had suffered nature’s furies — mitigation and adaptation occupied Centre stage at the negotiations. <br>At COP 19 in Warsaw in 2013, the issue finally received attention after the Philippines negotiator wept uncontrollably while speaking of the typhoon that had swept his country that year. The Warsaw International Mechanism was set up to “expand the understanding” of the concept. But it remained a non-starter. There has been relatively more progress in developing warning systems to protect people from weather vagaries but nothing at the scale required to meet the challenge at hand.<br>The question on every climate change observer’s lips is where the money for the new items on the COP’s agenda will come from. Denmark has pledged $13 million, while Scotland has promised $5.7 million. These do not even constitute drops in the ocean. <br>To put things in perspective, flooding in Pakistan this year inflicted close to $40 billion in damages. And, the economic loss from cyclone Amphan in India and Bangladesh in 2020 was assessed at $15 billion. With rich nations nowhere close to fulfilling their funding commitments in climate change mitigation and adaptation, “loss and damage” could become another polarising issue at Sharm El-Sheikh. There’s a growing realisation though that the issue cannot be put off for another year. COP-27’s success will depend on how negotiators resolve this tension.",

And only education and skill development can make this possible. Democracy cannot be sustained unless the electorate is well informed, chooses its leadership wisely, and this leadership is intellectually empowered by a multi-dimensional intelligence. <br>The world view of economic development has completely changed: it is no longer believed to be driven by human labor, as Karl Marx said, or by capital, as Alfred Marshall stated, but is knowledge-driven. For application of knowledge, innovations are required, and for more original research, we need many more young minds at the frontier. Knowledge is gender neutral, and hence the 21st century offers a great opportunity to level the gender inequity of the last thousand years in India.<br>The youth require a mental faculty endowed with multi-dimensional intelligence. It is not adequate to foster cognitive intelligence alone — as is being done in India’s educational campuses today — but to also develop the other dimensions of intelligence: emotional, social, moral, spiritual, environmental, and innovational. India’s vast youth population is its demographic potential dividend, but only if equipped and enabled with this seven-dimensional intelligence. <br>The nation must, therefore, structure a national education policy for the youth so that the seven dimensions of intelligence can be manifested in every young man and woman. Only then will the demographic dividend not be wasted. These seven dimensions constitute the ability of a person to live a productive life and for the national good. Hence, a policy for India’s youth has to be structured within the implied parameters of these dimensions.<br>The first parameter of such a policy is ability empowerment — the development of the seven types of intelligence. The second is a collective mindset about the legacy and future of the nation, which means knowing the correct de-falsified history of India. The third is the commitment to a social contract of rights and obligations such as a fundamental right to quality primary and secondary education, right to work, an obligation to compete for most positions of employment on merit, practice gender equality and place national interests above selfish interests. <br>A national education policy is, therefore, a framework for the comprehensive growth of the nation’s young population, to enable them to be positioned in life for personal advancement as well as contribute to national greatness. India, however, lacks today a properly structured policy for development of its youth. As a result, many young people are led astray by drugs and crime.<br>Q. 1 According to the passage, why democracy is important?<br>Q. 2 Discuss how democracy empowers the youth.<br>Q.3 Discuss the three parameters of the policy implementation.<br>Q. 4 What is the purpose of the author to write this article?",
